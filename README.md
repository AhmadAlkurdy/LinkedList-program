# LinkedList-program
a linked list program that will read the names of 2 input data files from the command
//line 
//The data is to be placed in an ordered linked list by lastName, firstName, age.

//1)	Finish If an incomplete record is read in report the error and discard the input.

//2)	If a duplicate record is found report the duplicate but DO NOT put it in the list.

//3)	Finish If your program reads in a blank line, ignore it. DO NOT REPORT ANYTHING.

//4)	Once the sorted list is created, print it (to the screen). 

//The second file will contain a list of names to delete from the list 

//1)	If a name to delete is not found in the list, report it  and continue.

//2)	As you delete a name, report the deletion (the name/age).

//3)	Once all deletions are completed, print out the remaining list.

//4)	Delete the list and print the list out again. (Yes, you will be printing an empty list.)
